# Yazt
> Yet another ZSH theme 

Yazt is a simple yet challenging ZSH theme manager in maintence that is compatible with nearly everything. You can use prompts in plugins, mix 'n' match two themes, with a few modifications, you can even use it in bash, then even fish.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/bashelled/yazt.git ~/.yazt
cp ~/.yazt/etc/templates/rcs/zshrc ~/.zshrc
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```
###### You can use the .deb in the Releases tab. See docs/debian.md.

By default, no themes are added. You can add them yourself or copy from sources like [Oh My ZSH](ohmyz.sh) or [Bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it).
